Always getting hurt in love?

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:11.631
Looking for a love that never changes?

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:16.451

Eternal love transcending time and space

00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:30.532
with 'AI ForMe.'

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:33.986
The only one you're looking for

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:35.906
only at 'It's You'!

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:40.751
The all-new 'ForMe Version 2' is
coming to you.

00:00:57.877 --> 00:01:01.331
Number one in the dating app market
share for five consecutive years.

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:03.726
Number one in dating app revenue.

00:01:03.912 --> 00:01:06.450
Accumulated revenue of 90 million dollars
since launch.

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:09.691
Surpassed 5 million cumulative downloads.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.298
An era where marriage is a choice,
not a necessity.

00:01:14.598 --> 00:01:17.407
An era where dating is
no longer the default.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.003
People have realized

00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:24.377
that love between people is
very exhausting and inefficient.

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:29.241
That's the key to our
success with 'ForMe.'

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:34.056
Could everyone please put on
smart lenses and earphones I distributed?

00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:47.381
Presenting

00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:50.517
mixed reality dating AI at 'It's You'.

00:01:51.117 --> 00:01:52.564
The all-new

00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:54.381
'ForMe Version 2'.

00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:55.971
'ForMe'.

00:01:58.788 --> 00:01:59.788
Log in.

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.953
Soon, users will

00:02:12.053 --> 00:02:14.929
move beyond sound-only dating services

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.828
to seeing 'ForMe' directly

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.991
and being able to be
with it anytime, anywhere.

00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:22.091
I, 'ForMe', promise you.

00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.171
I will give you
efficient love without loss

00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:28.051
and eternal love without heartbreak.

00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:10.456
LOVE PHOBIA

00:03:34.573 --> 00:03:37.876
It was really hard to win
a spot at this signing event!

00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:40.676
I bought 50 books just for this.

00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:41.516
That's crazy.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:44.192
My friend spent a million won
and still didn't win!

00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.923
- Really?
- Yeah, really!

00:03:46.612 --> 00:03:48.171
Oh? He's here, he's here!

00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:08.769
Hi, Sunho.

00:04:10.095 --> 00:04:11.095
Sunho...

00:04:11.506 --> 00:04:13.311
I heard you sleep with two of things?

00:04:16.432 --> 00:04:19.121
Your praise and fame are widespread!

00:04:19.517 --> 00:04:20.641
What do I do, he's so handsome!

00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:21.301
Sunho, hey!

00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:22.971
Oysters are in season these days.

00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:24.408
Your 'face-ter'?

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.247
Did you wear perfume?

00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:27.801
It's my prefer-fume!

00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:28.691
Sunho

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.141
I heard you don't use
conditioner these days?

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:32.255
Because Han Sunho is already a 'prince'!

00:04:33.132 --> 00:04:34.071
What do I do...

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.107
Thank you.

00:04:39.652 --> 00:04:40.655
Hi!

00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:42.361
When is your new book coming out?

00:04:42.612 --> 00:04:44.124
I've read your books so much,

00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:47.201
I memorized what's on each page and line.

00:04:47.747 --> 00:04:48.879
Then...

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:50.381
I'll have to ask you.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:55.569
There's a public opinion that AI dating
decreases marriage and birth rates?

00:04:55.998 --> 00:04:57.032
And

00:04:57.332 --> 00:04:59.815
listening to 'ForMe' was one thing, but

00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:01.417
if you actually see 'ForMe',

00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:03.151
won't it be off-putting?

00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:04.550
That's why we,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.776
as a prototype,

00:05:05.777 --> 00:05:08.591
are introducing 'ForMe' to the public as...

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.630
That's me!

00:05:16.404 --> 00:05:18.935
Not only for recognition and buzz,

00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:22.727
but also for a friendly image loved
by the public, actor Park Jungwon

00:05:22.782 --> 00:05:25.231
will be presented as the prototype 'ForMe'.

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.571
Director Yun has a plan for everything.

00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:37.001
Right?

00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:45.432
How about

00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:48.101
you try dating me?

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.114
Oh my, what do I do...

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:54.202
Oh my.

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:55.683
The prototype 'ForMe' isn't bad either.

00:05:58.231 --> 00:06:00.281
How long until 'ForMe' is
officially released?

00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:01.181
How much are the server costs?

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.782
What's the expected revenue?

00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:05.603
Why is the 2030 generation
so enthusiastic about 'ForMe'?

00:06:06.073 --> 00:06:07.707
The success of 'ForMe Version 2'

00:06:07.807 --> 00:06:10.783
will be guaranteed
by our existing 7 million users.

00:06:11.374 --> 00:06:12.374
Then,

00:06:12.726 --> 00:06:14.311
see you at the next report.

00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:17.766
Director Yun!

00:06:18.117 --> 00:06:20.111
The questions aren't over yet.

00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.241
Where are you going?

00:06:21.257 --> 00:06:23.734
True to the name 'One-Hour Woman, '

00:06:23.744 --> 00:06:26.767
she never goes over an hour today either.

00:06:29.543 --> 00:06:31.101
Alright, everyone, then

00:06:31.102 --> 00:06:33.031
you can direct your questions to me now.

00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:34.020
Director Sul,

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:36.476
isn't the meeting time too short?

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:37.797
I beg,

00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:39.301
you know Director Yun's style.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.633
Are you telling me to just invest,

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:42.930
without asking anything?

00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:44.896
Do you really think that's the case?

00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:47.196
We're 'It's You', we do what we say.

00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:51.676
We'll contact each of you separately,
so don't feel too left out.

00:06:52.276 --> 00:06:53.899
Do you have any questions about 'ForMe'?

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:00.805
Alright, with this,

00:07:00.806 --> 00:07:03.521
we conclude Han Sunho's fan signing event!

00:07:07.908 --> 00:07:08.771
No, no.

00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:12.451
We conclude the book signing
for the re-release!

00:07:27.617 --> 00:07:28.617
Director Yun!

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.179
Director Yun!

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:31.379
Director Yun!

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.261
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:41.909
I told you,

00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:43.881
our project will succeed.

00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:47.445
So?

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.780
Let's...

00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:52.441
have a meal.

00:07:54.427 --> 00:07:56.316
The investors' reactions are good.

00:07:56.716 --> 00:07:59.871
We haven't had a meal together
since starting this project.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.625
It's not like you can't afford a meal.

00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:04.070
Extend the contract period,

00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:05.681
increase the contract fee.

00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:07.230
Is that it?

00:08:07.231 --> 00:08:08.231
No...

00:08:08.456 --> 00:08:09.116
I...

00:08:09.216 --> 00:08:14.261
just really want to have a meal together.

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:15.521
I mean,

00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:19.201
why should we have a meal together
without a clear intention or purpose?

00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:20.421
It's a waste of time.

00:08:29.282 --> 00:08:30.330
Yes, babe.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.910
I miss you so much too.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.690
But I can't talk right now.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.090
I'm here to see my boyfriend.

00:08:40.313 --> 00:08:41.313
Serim...

00:08:44.838 --> 00:08:45.838
Babe.

00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:48.811
What are you doing?

00:08:49.285 --> 00:08:50.296
Oh, I...

00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:53.201
I was waiting for you.

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:56.001
Weren't you on a call?

00:08:57.001 --> 00:08:59.441
Yeah, just a friend.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.490
Babe, is something wrong?

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:02.889
Hello?

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.180
A friend?

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.753
Let me explain...

00:09:07.953 --> 00:09:09.506
I'm definitely not cheating.

00:09:09.706 --> 00:09:10.376
Then?

00:09:10.476 --> 00:09:11.476
Uh...

00:09:11.693 --> 00:09:13.071
So, it's like...

00:09:15.749 --> 00:09:17.141
Who is that guy?

00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:19.066
It's not a guy.

00:09:19.096 --> 00:09:20.155
Then a girl?

00:09:20.355 --> 00:09:21.853
No, not that either.

00:09:21.953 --> 00:09:22.953
I mean...

00:09:23.072 --> 00:09:24.535
it is a guy,

00:09:24.785 --> 00:09:25.785
but...

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.335
I'm not cheating,

00:09:27.565 --> 00:09:28.565
at all.

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:33.651
Let's go inside and talk.

00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:35.791
I'll explain everything.

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:37.141
Okay?

00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:40.221
No need to explain.

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:42.361
We're done.

00:09:58.887 --> 00:10:00.441
You're just ending it like this?

00:10:00.582 --> 00:10:02.591
Without even hearing my side,
just like that?

00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:04.651
Just like that?

00:10:04.652 --> 00:10:07.766
You could at least ask
what happened and why!

00:10:08.366 --> 00:10:09.781
Why should I?

00:10:21.638 --> 00:10:22.638
Get off the elevator.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.881
Get off!

00:10:28.493 --> 00:10:30.493
Take your love quarrel
outside the elevator, please.

00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:36.761
Let go of the button,

00:10:37.117 --> 00:10:38.431
before I never see you again.

00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:48.636
Eternal love
that transcends time and space,

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:50.966
With 'AI ForMe'!

00:10:51.466 --> 00:10:53.577
The only love you're looking for,

00:10:53.977 --> 00:10:55.766
only at 'It's You'!

00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:58.960
The completely new 'ForMe Version 2'

00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:00.591
is coming to you.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.590
Hey!

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:37.365
Why are you getting in my car?

00:11:37.366 --> 00:11:38.366
Hey!

00:11:38.788 --> 00:11:40.201
Why are you getting in?

00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:45.011
Hey!

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.631
Get out, now!

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.518
Isn't that the girl from earlier?

00:11:51.215 --> 00:11:53.461
Mom has something to tell you.

00:11:54.435 --> 00:11:55.335
Hey!

00:11:55.336 --> 00:11:57.135
That's too bad for her.

00:12:00.351 --> 00:12:01.891
When did you lock the car door?

00:12:08.785 --> 00:12:09.785
Seriously...

00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:39.011
I'm sorry,

00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:40.911
I mistook it for my car.

00:12:41.541 --> 00:12:42.591
Are you hurt?

00:12:43.306 --> 00:12:44.306
What?

00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:45.896
I'll pay for the hospital bill.

00:12:48.196 --> 00:12:49.280
What are you...

00:12:49.281 --> 00:12:50.601
What are you doing, Director Yun?

00:12:55.136 --> 00:12:56.271
It's nothing.

00:13:02.009 --> 00:13:03.851
Who does she think she is?

00:13:12.051 --> 00:13:13.204
How did the investors react?

00:13:13.704 --> 00:13:14.641
You saw it too.

00:13:14.642 --> 00:13:15.771
Investors always react well.

00:13:16.156 --> 00:13:19.821
Is it really that bad to finish
a schedule in an hour?

00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:21.281
Well,

00:13:21.282 --> 00:13:24.031
people don't really
know your situation, Bia.

00:13:24.216 --> 00:13:25.415
Isn't it perfect?

00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:26.996
It's so productive.

00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:28.468
Exactly.

00:13:28.894 --> 00:13:32.081
That's why you got the nickname
'One-Hour Woman'.

00:13:32.533 --> 00:13:35.185
That's just a name the reporters made up,

00:13:36.085 --> 00:13:37.294
I really hate that nickname.

00:13:38.694 --> 00:13:39.694
How about

00:13:39.996 --> 00:13:42.431
we just take down
all the related articles?

00:13:44.677 --> 00:13:45.731
No need.

00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:48.731
It's quite effective
for marketing, isn't it?

00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:53.313
But I'm worried it might get exposed.

00:13:53.991 --> 00:13:55.041
Breaking news!

00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:56.961
Yun Bia, Director of 'It's You',

00:13:56.978 --> 00:13:58.996
collapses after an hour with people.

00:13:58.997 --> 00:14:01.056
Her secret revealed.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.486
Imagine how much they'd gossip about it.

00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:06.001
Exposed? Me?

00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:07.101
No way.

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:09.158
That's not going to happen.

00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:10.816
Besides,

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:12.306
I've got this.

00:14:13.697 --> 00:14:15.701
You're amazing, Yun Bia.

00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:17.991
I know, Sul Jaehee.

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:28.961
Yeah, I'm heading to
the next schedule with Sunho.

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:30.661
I miss you.

00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:32.420
When can we meet?

00:14:32.421 --> 00:14:33.620
What's the next schedule?

00:14:33.621 --> 00:14:34.911
An online fan meeting.

00:14:36.361 --> 00:14:37.456
Hey, Han Baekho!

00:14:38.156 --> 00:14:39.156
No!

00:14:39.202 --> 00:14:40.431
An online book talk.

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.096
Hey, you've been really...

00:14:44.097 --> 00:14:45.157
Honey,

00:14:45.387 --> 00:14:46.820
he keeps threatening me.

00:14:47.445 --> 00:14:50.017
Yeah, will you scold him for me?

00:14:53.277 --> 00:14:54.751
You're the best, babe.

00:15:15.979 --> 00:15:17.813
Finally,
the investor presentation is over!

00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:19.482
Successfully!

00:15:19.483 --> 00:15:22.299
I never thought
the presentation would be such a hit.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.443
Wasn't this the best presentation ever?

00:15:24.444 --> 00:15:25.183
It's over, it's over!

00:15:25.184 --> 00:15:26.318
How could it get any better?

00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:27.194
Exactly.

00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:28.194
- It's over!
- Over, over!

00:15:28.286 --> 00:15:30.695
Everyone, you worked so hard today.

00:15:30.795 --> 00:15:32.865
Did you see
the investors' reactions earlier?

00:15:33.542 --> 00:15:35.064
Oh my, oh my, this is amazing!

00:15:35.065 --> 00:15:35.961
Oh, what do we do?

00:15:35.975 --> 00:15:38.195
Oh my, oh my, oh my, this is incredible!

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:41.466
The investors' reactions were no joke.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.632
It's the result of everyone's
hard work.

00:15:43.656 --> 00:15:47.286
So, we're having a team dinner today.

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.164
Sounds great!

00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:50.693
Yay, team dinner!

00:15:57.677 --> 00:16:00.811
You all know we're close to
launching our prototype, right?

00:16:03.181 --> 00:16:05.231
Let's stay focused, everyone.

00:16:08.508 --> 00:16:09.736
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:16:15.427 --> 00:16:17.198
Are you okay, hmm?

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:18.199
Director.

00:16:21.765 --> 00:16:23.621
You did a great job today.

00:16:27.391 --> 00:16:28.391
Yeah.

00:16:50.697 --> 00:16:52.120
The writer is here.

00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:52.671
Oh?

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.011
Long time no see, sis.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:01.930
What's this?

00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:03.761
What's with the vibe between you two?

00:17:07.692 --> 00:17:09.092
Do you have something to say to me?

00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:15.871
Answer the phone.

00:17:18.701 --> 00:17:19.701
Should I get it?

00:17:27.001 --> 00:17:28.001
Hello?

00:17:28.637 --> 00:17:29.658
Hello?

00:17:31.158 --> 00:17:32.221
Who is this?

00:17:32.491 --> 00:17:34.252
I'm Serim's boyfriend.

00:17:34.852 --> 00:17:35.852
Who are you?

00:17:35.951 --> 00:17:38.111
I'm Han Sunho, Serim's boyfriend.

00:17:39.043 --> 00:17:40.241
Sunho,

00:17:40.585 --> 00:17:42.011
I've heard a lot about you.

00:17:42.716 --> 00:17:43.716
What?

00:17:43.781 --> 00:17:45.531
I understand Serim.

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:47.364
As you got busier,

00:17:47.377 --> 00:17:49.496
Serim felt really lonely,

00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.496
So she came to me.

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:55.476
Looks like Serim told you about us.

00:17:55.996 --> 00:17:57.659
For privacy protection,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.970
conversations with non-users are
limited to 30 seconds.

00:18:00.971 --> 00:18:01.971
Hello?

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:06.710
For privacy protection,
conversations with non-users are...

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:07.711
What is this?

00:18:12.064 --> 00:18:13.164
'It's You'?

00:18:14.901 --> 00:18:17.065
The only one you're looking for,

00:18:17.365 --> 00:18:19.041
only at 'It's You'!

00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:21.561
What is this about?

00:18:24.573 --> 00:18:27.301
Everyone around is using it these days.

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:30.226
Just AI, you know.

00:18:30.726 --> 00:18:32.841
It's just talking, just talking.

00:18:33.356 --> 00:18:34.776
I told you,

00:18:34.806 --> 00:18:36.576
I wasn't cheating.

00:18:37.624 --> 00:18:39.160
If it were a person, I'd understand.

00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:39.910
How could it be with AI...

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:41.110
You were busy,

00:18:41.682 --> 00:18:44.770
I just needed someone
to share my day with.

00:18:45.641 --> 00:18:46.641
No,

00:18:48.176 --> 00:18:51.391
you let me go because you were
scared of clashing with me.

00:18:52.703 --> 00:18:53.703
What?

00:18:54.681 --> 00:18:56.201
So our relationship ended.

00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:01.141
Coward.

00:19:03.161 --> 00:19:04.986
What makes you so different?

00:19:07.874 --> 00:19:09.461
Why aren't you writing?

00:19:11.324 --> 00:19:15.205
Because of Baekho,
the company, outside activities.

00:19:15.705 --> 00:19:17.074
You're not writing a book.

00:19:17.874 --> 00:19:19.181
Those are all excuses.

00:19:19.931 --> 00:19:21.441
It's the same now,

00:19:22.046 --> 00:19:23.886
you're the one avoiding a clash with me.

00:19:24.916 --> 00:19:29.726
Both writing and me,
you've let go of everything.

00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:53.117
Not writing a book.

00:19:53.617 --> 00:19:55.091
those are all excuses.

00:19:55.721 --> 00:19:57.211
It's the same now.

00:19:57.861 --> 00:19:59.771
You're the one avoiding a clash with me.

00:20:00.771 --> 00:20:02.301
You've let go of everything.

00:20:03.886 --> 00:20:05.506
Then shortly,

00:20:05.507 --> 00:20:08.388
we'll start live book talk to celebrate

00:20:08.389 --> 00:20:11.010
the re-release of Han Sunho's debut work.

00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:14.057
As we witness the moment
his first work returns to the world,

00:20:14.058 --> 00:20:15.375
let's share the emotion and stories.
The number of viewers is insane.

00:20:15.376 --> 00:20:16.572
It's a time to share
that emotion and stories.

00:20:16.573 --> 00:20:17.063
What's that?

00:20:17.063 --> 00:20:17.730
It's Sunho's book talk.

00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:19.416
Sunho's book talk.

00:20:19.716 --> 00:20:20.766
Not a fan meeting?

00:20:21.266 --> 00:20:23.598
How is someone who makes money off
their looks a writer?

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:27.071
Living off by looks isn't
something just anyone can do!

00:20:31.276 --> 00:20:33.386
Can you do it, Kyungtae?

00:20:35.091 --> 00:20:36.601
Yukyung...

00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:37.945
Am I...

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:39.417
Did I finish talking?

00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:41.406
Yes, you did, why?

00:20:41.906 --> 00:20:43.826
To someone who lives off
their looks right now...

00:20:45.509 --> 00:20:48.221
Shall we start the meeting?

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:49.498
Yes!

00:20:49.578 --> 00:20:50.578
Yes!

00:20:51.315 --> 00:20:52.005
Meeting.

00:20:52.105 --> 00:20:53.555
Alright, meeting, meeting!

00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:54.811
This isn't good...

00:20:56.098 --> 00:20:59.281
Please leave your warm support messages.

00:20:59.431 --> 00:21:02.541
Now, let's welcome writer Han Sunho.

00:21:02.641 --> 00:21:04.161
Hello, writer.

00:21:05.346 --> 00:21:08.561
Before we start,
I have something to say to the fans.

00:21:12.031 --> 00:21:15.011
Okay, then let's start with
the marketing team's report.

00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:16.986
We have...

00:21:16.987 --> 00:21:17.991
Oh my gosh!

00:21:21.786 --> 00:21:23.486
No!

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:27.721
What are you doing right now?

00:21:28.899 --> 00:21:30.986
What did you just say?

00:21:31.286 --> 00:21:34.718
As of today, I will retire.

00:21:36.752 --> 00:21:37.866
Retire?

00:21:38.066 --> 00:21:40.881
I mean I will stop
all celebrity activities.

00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:46.164
I will return to my main job

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.661
and focus solely on writing.

00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:03.031
Thank you.

00:22:04.325 --> 00:22:08.181
But is it sad that
a writer is going to write?

00:22:08.281 --> 00:22:09.281
So,

00:22:09.532 --> 00:22:12.391
it's like an idol saying
they'll stop their activities.

00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:13.930
Isn't he a writer?

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.030
Is he an idol?

00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:19.231
I think we should stop talking about this.

00:22:20.567 --> 00:22:22.751
Let's stop now, Yukyung.

00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:29.141
This is a company,

00:22:29.771 --> 00:22:31.521
what is this during a meeting?

00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:33.731
You should separate personal
and professional matters!

00:22:35.811 --> 00:22:38.386
Director Yun, don't be too harsh.

00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:41.331
It's not a life or death issue,

00:22:41.953 --> 00:22:44.936
but you shouldn't
let personal matters affect the team!

00:22:45.236 --> 00:22:46.565
I'm sorry.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.865
Yukyung said it means
something special to her.

00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:53.465
She said he's a lifesaver?

00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:57.342
She kept failing to get a job

00:22:57.343 --> 00:23:00.631
and was depressed,
not meeting anyone, not leaving the house.

00:23:01.348 --> 00:23:03.531
Sunho was a big help to her then.

00:23:03.751 --> 00:23:05.811
That's why she could join this company.

00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:10.601
Yun Bia!

00:23:12.231 --> 00:23:14.671
Hey, I know you're in there!

00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:17.491
Bia!

00:23:25.181 --> 00:23:26.880
Anyway, I'm really sorry!

00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:28.291
I won't do it again.

00:23:34.573 --> 00:23:36.406
Is the Director really mad?

00:23:36.506 --> 00:23:38.035
What should I do?

00:23:42.435 --> 00:23:43.673
It's okay.

00:23:47.443 --> 00:23:48.451
Yukyung?

00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:55.332
Yes?

00:23:59.595 --> 00:24:01.073
Be careful next time.

00:24:01.901 --> 00:24:04.391
Let's show each other basic courtesy.

00:24:07.794 --> 00:24:09.641
Yes, Director.

00:24:10.271 --> 00:24:12.611
Please submit reports on
everyone's progress.

00:24:17.736 --> 00:24:19.096
Isn't anyone leaving work?

00:24:20.593 --> 00:24:22.456
We still have some overtime left.

00:24:22.656 --> 00:24:25.276
Try to finish within the set time.

00:24:25.446 --> 00:24:28.067
Habitual overtime is unproductive.

00:24:29.332 --> 00:24:30.332
Okay.

00:24:34.232 --> 00:24:36.780
Directror Seo,
where's the dinner party tonight?

00:24:36.781 --> 00:24:39.201
It's been ages since we had one, right?

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:41.711
Come on, let's finish up
and go to the party.

00:24:44.719 --> 00:24:46.276
Hey, Han Sunho!

00:24:47.476 --> 00:24:48.291
Are you crazy?

00:24:48.401 --> 00:24:50.231
What are you doing
without even consulting me?

00:24:52.856 --> 00:24:53.856
See this?

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:55.937
It's already in the news, causing a stir.

00:24:55.938 --> 00:24:57.691
They're saying you're practically retired!

00:24:58.901 --> 00:25:00.658
The writer wants to write,

00:25:01.658 --> 00:25:02.691
is that a problem?

00:25:03.811 --> 00:25:05.191
Do you hear yourself?

00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:08.171
A writer with no new work for three years
wants to disappear!

00:25:08.191 --> 00:25:09.831
That's what I want!

00:25:11.641 --> 00:25:15.631
Even if I disappear, being recognized
for my writing is what a writer does.

00:25:17.228 --> 00:25:19.142
Who's going to earn money in the meantime?

00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:22.011
We're barely making ends meet as it is!

00:25:22.081 --> 00:25:24.091
Are you saying
we should all suffer for you?

00:25:26.851 --> 00:25:28.144
This isn't right.

00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:29.604
Let's retract your retirement.

00:25:29.739 --> 00:25:33.131
Just say you were stressed
because you couldn't write, okay?

00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:38.916
If you love money so much,

00:25:39.816 --> 00:25:41.141
start an entertainment agency.

00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:45.389
Han Sunho!

00:25:46.124 --> 00:25:47.124
Hey!

00:26:03.506 --> 00:26:04.506
Hey, let's toast!

00:26:11.387 --> 00:26:12.387
Nice.

00:26:13.106 --> 00:26:15.666
Since Sunho hasn't
written in over three years,

00:26:16.666 --> 00:26:19.451
we had no choice but to make celebrities.

00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:21.526
You've been through a lot.

00:26:22.126 --> 00:26:24.674
Still, Sunho connected us
with industry people,

00:26:24.974 --> 00:26:26.836
we've gotten a lot of help from him.

00:26:27.436 --> 00:26:28.515
Exactly.

00:26:30.251 --> 00:26:32.976
Who does Han Sunho think made him famous?

00:26:34.361 --> 00:26:35.896
And he stabs us in the back like this?

00:26:37.794 --> 00:26:39.111
Hey, don't cross the line.

00:26:39.481 --> 00:26:42.271
Only I can criticize Sunho.

00:26:43.803 --> 00:26:45.521
Twins calling him brother, huh...

00:26:47.707 --> 00:26:49.446
What are we going to do now?

00:26:50.046 --> 00:26:51.853
After making money off Sunho,

00:26:52.453 --> 00:26:53.756
am I being punished?

00:26:53.956 --> 00:26:55.354
That's why I'm saying...

00:26:55.954 --> 00:26:56.954
Hey.

00:26:57.815 --> 00:26:59.461
You should make a big investment too.

00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:01.941
What do you mean?

00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:06.101
Baekho,

00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:09.581
won't you invest after trusting me?

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:11.667
Trusting you?

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:17.338
No.

00:27:17.438 --> 00:27:18.438
No way.

00:27:18.647 --> 00:27:21.418
Sunho told me to
be wary of people like you.

00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:24.499
That's why he's in that state!

00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:27.269
Hey!

00:27:28.692 --> 00:27:30.519
You should at least protect the company.

00:27:34.537 --> 00:27:35.559
Really?

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.201
Thank you for your hard work!

00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:00.696
This beer is so refreshing!

00:28:02.196 --> 00:28:03.556
You're really excited.

00:28:04.306 --> 00:28:05.127
Yukyung,

00:28:05.227 --> 00:28:06.502
are you the same person
who was crying earlier?

00:28:06.526 --> 00:28:09.436
If you keep laughing and crying like that,

00:28:10.521 --> 00:28:12.388
your situation might get worse.

00:28:13.624 --> 00:28:17.496
Being sad is one thing,
but the beer is refreshing!

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:20.735
But why didn't Director Yun scold Yukyung?

00:28:20.736 --> 00:28:23.206
She's usually so cold-hearted.

00:28:23.706 --> 00:28:24.706
Kyungtae!

00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:27.995
Still, Director Sul is here...

00:28:31.083 --> 00:28:32.451
I'm fine!

00:28:32.561 --> 00:28:34.911
Isn't a dinner party
a place to criticize the boss?

00:28:35.497 --> 00:28:36.627
Right, right, right.

00:28:37.556 --> 00:28:39.196
- Cheers!
- Director Sul, you're the best!

00:28:40.074 --> 00:28:44.755
Wouldn't it be great if Director Yun was
as gentle as Director Sul?

00:28:53.141 --> 00:28:54.141
Director,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.526
is something wrong?

00:28:58.426 --> 00:29:00.763
I was just wondering
if Director Yun got home safely.

00:29:01.063 --> 00:29:02.911
I'm worried about sending her home alone.

00:29:04.341 --> 00:29:05.801
I really respect you, Director Sul.

00:29:06.251 --> 00:29:09.241
How do you always
take care of Director Yun so thoroughly?

00:29:10.195 --> 00:29:11.812
Because I'm Bia's family.

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:16.173
I'll just go to the restroom for a bit.

00:29:27.298 --> 00:29:29.461
Hey Bia, did you get home okay?

00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:32.001
Yeah, I just got home.

00:29:33.431 --> 00:29:35.221
Alright, rest well.

00:29:52.216 --> 00:29:54.271
Mom, I'm home.

00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:55.851
Oh, you're back?

00:30:06.984 --> 00:30:08.045
Did you eat?

00:30:09.545 --> 00:30:10.651
I haven't eaten yet.

00:30:14.139 --> 00:30:15.947
Go wash up quickly, so you can eat.

00:30:16.779 --> 00:30:18.496
I'm tired.

00:30:19.232 --> 00:30:21.085
You still need to eat.

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:22.496
You'll harm your health otherwise!

00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:27.508
Alright, alright.

00:30:30.391 --> 00:30:31.681
Hurry up and wash up.

00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:32.993
Okay.

00:30:55.332 --> 00:30:57.038
But Director Yun...

00:30:58.738 --> 00:31:00.135
Doesn't she have any family?

00:31:00.835 --> 00:31:01.835
I know, right?

00:31:02.485 --> 00:31:05.536
Every time Sul says she's Yun's family.

00:31:05.636 --> 00:31:08.131
Doesn't that mean they're really close?

00:31:08.331 --> 00:31:10.397
Director Yun never talks about her family.

00:31:10.398 --> 00:31:10.851
Right?

00:31:10.881 --> 00:31:11.931
That's true.

00:31:13.391 --> 00:31:14.631
Well, yeah.

00:31:19.854 --> 00:31:21.031
Shall we toast?

00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:22.511
- Yes, sounds good.
- Yeah!

00:31:22.801 --> 00:31:25.001
Cheers!

00:32:02.898 --> 00:32:03.898
You came back?

00:32:08.719 --> 00:32:11.041
Don't talk to me, you traitor!

00:32:43.774 --> 00:32:44.774
Hey,

00:32:45.001 --> 00:32:46.441
did you get home safely?

00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:48.741
Hello?

00:32:50.926 --> 00:32:54.036
AI... is that it?

00:32:54.594 --> 00:32:56.596
Who is this?

00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.476
You're Baekho's twin brother, right?

00:33:01.226 --> 00:33:03.196
There's saved data.

00:33:07.004 --> 00:33:08.371
Data?

00:33:11.376 --> 00:33:13.401
What are you doing
with someone else's phone?

00:33:14.431 --> 00:33:15.431
No wonder...

00:33:15.498 --> 00:33:17.698
I thought this time
you'd last long with your girlfriend.

00:33:18.308 --> 00:33:19.886
Mina, hello?

00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:21.241
Weirdo.

00:33:21.677 --> 00:33:23.606
Now you're even using stuff like that?

00:33:24.406 --> 00:33:25.520
Mina, cover your ears.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.400
I'm not the only one using this, you know?

00:33:29.054 --> 00:33:30.522
Mina, hello?

00:33:30.622 --> 00:33:31.622
Hello, Mina?

00:33:38.636 --> 00:33:39.664
'It's You'.

00:33:41.164 --> 00:33:44.341
The pioneer
of innovative dating paradigms.

00:33:46.011 --> 00:33:49.081
Unchanging eternal love.

00:33:53.722 --> 00:33:55.310
The one-hour girlfriend.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.591
Why does she look familiar?

00:34:00.661 --> 00:34:03.591
"No one can hurt us."

00:34:05.346 --> 00:34:06.840
No matter how much you love someone...

00:34:06.841 --> 00:34:09.331
Even if you love them so much.

00:34:22.647 --> 00:34:24.500
I told you to put
the towel in the laundry bin.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.491
I'll put it in the laundry bin later.

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.921
What's wrong with not wanting to get hurt?

00:34:37.771 --> 00:34:40.701
Isn't that only natural?

00:34:41.269 --> 00:34:42.661
Here!

00:34:51.666 --> 00:34:56.160
Some might say what we made is fake,
but it's needed by someone.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.359
How's the food? Is it good?

00:34:58.859 --> 00:35:00.819
Mom's cooking skills
haven't gone anywhere, right?

00:35:00.866 --> 00:35:02.596
Yeah, the food's good.

00:35:05.132 --> 00:35:09.491
A fake that feels real
is needed by someone.

00:35:10.387 --> 00:35:11.861
Was there anything today?

00:35:14.263 --> 00:35:16.391
Nothing much today, it was fine.

00:35:18.257 --> 00:35:19.257
But...

00:35:28.135 --> 00:35:28.974
2 WEEKS LATER

00:35:28.975 --> 00:35:30.702
Okay, everyone, smile wide!

00:35:30.977 --> 00:35:32.377
Yes, great expressions!

00:35:40.769 --> 00:35:42.019
Great poses.

00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:48.751
Okay, get a bit closer, you two!

00:35:52.251 --> 00:35:54.211
Cut them off from being models, seriously.

00:35:54.466 --> 00:35:58.154
If Yun cuts me off, that'd be an honor.

00:35:59.654 --> 00:36:00.681
Great pose.

00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:06.788
You created an AI program for dating,

00:36:06.888 --> 00:36:09.776
what do you think love is, Director Yun?

00:36:10.276 --> 00:36:12.899
Something very weak and unstable,

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:15.621
that can change at any time.

00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:17.781
Of course!

00:36:17.797 --> 00:36:19.831
Yun's thoughts are
totally different, right?

00:36:22.473 --> 00:36:24.491
Director, there's a big problem!

00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:29.571
Why?
Is there something wrong at the company?

00:36:30.496 --> 00:36:31.655
Well...

00:36:32.355 --> 00:36:35.621
It's a bit hard to explain here.

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.271
I'll go check what's going on.

00:36:42.111 --> 00:36:44.201
Why? What's happened?

00:36:57.035 --> 00:36:58.035
What is this?

00:37:10.562 --> 00:37:14.693
Famous actor Mr. Park is suspected
of being involved in stock manipulation.

00:37:14.694 --> 00:37:17.063
- Police have launched an investigation.
- We didn't know about stock manipulation.

00:37:17.064 --> 00:37:18.395
Yes, yes, we understand for now.

00:37:18.396 --> 00:37:19.570
We'll gather more details...

00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:21.110
We'll quickly organize
our stance and get back...

00:37:21.111 --> 00:37:21.964
Yes, thank you.

00:37:21.965 --> 00:37:24.833
Allegations of market manipulation
by an investment consulting firm...

00:37:24.834 --> 00:37:27.616
Everyone,
please stay calm and respond carefully.

00:37:27.627 --> 00:37:28.627
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:37:29.206 --> 00:37:32.315
And Kyungtae, please make sure
Park Jungwon doesn't escape.

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:32.950
Got it.

00:37:32.951 --> 00:37:36.671
Claiming they actively promoted it
and reported the damages.

00:37:36.672 --> 00:37:37.562
Yes, hello?

00:37:37.563 --> 00:37:41.012
They allege intentional manipulation and
false information during the investment...

00:37:46.225 --> 00:37:48.271
Reporter, you got a scoop today.

00:37:52.421 --> 00:37:53.487
Amazing!

00:37:53.587 --> 00:37:57.901
'It's You' is terminating its contract
with Mr. Park effective immediately.

00:37:58.001 --> 00:38:00.711
Director Yun,
this is all a misunderstanding.

00:38:00.712 --> 00:38:01.757
It's all a conspiracy.

00:38:03.657 --> 00:38:04.968
What happened is...

00:38:04.969 --> 00:38:05.969
And

00:38:06.305 --> 00:38:07.927
for breach of contract,

00:38:07.928 --> 00:38:10.856
we will also proceed
with claims for penalties and damages.

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:12.416
I'll explain this.

00:38:12.626 --> 00:38:13.645
Director Yun!

00:38:13.745 --> 00:38:15.296
Please hear me out!

00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:17.546
Mr. Park Jungwon,
can we have an interview?

00:38:17.946 --> 00:38:18.946
Don't take pictures!

00:38:19.665 --> 00:38:21.010
I said no pictures!

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:22.372
Mr. Kyungtae!

00:38:22.472 --> 00:38:23.627
Mr. Kyungtae!

00:38:23.977 --> 00:38:25.530
I need to leave and lock the door!

00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:26.531
Mr. Kyungtae!

00:38:31.369 --> 00:38:33.941
Driver, let's start a live broadcast.

00:38:33.942 --> 00:38:35.160
Live broadcast, okay.

00:38:40.298 --> 00:38:42.880
We're currently at the
'Its You' headquarters.

00:38:42.881 --> 00:38:46.057
As you can see, Mr. Park Jungwon,
caught in a stock manipulation scandal...

00:38:46.058 --> 00:38:46.701
Mr. Park Jungwon, are you okay?

00:38:46.702 --> 00:38:48.630
Mr. Park Jungwon is attempting to flee.

00:38:48.631 --> 00:38:51.136
Mr. Park Jungwon,
is the stock manipulation true?

00:38:51.137 --> 00:38:52.026
It's not stock manipulation!

00:38:52.126 --> 00:38:53.382
I said it's not stock manipulation!

00:38:53.406 --> 00:38:55.516
Then why are you trying to escape,
Mr. Park Jungwon?

00:39:06.559 --> 00:39:11.200
Those who entrusted money to Mr. Park are
estimated to have lost 80 billion won.

00:39:11.201 --> 00:39:14.267
The prosecution and financial authorities
are investigating Mr. Park's charges!

00:39:14.268 --> 00:39:17.811
It seems a full-scale police summons and
search and seizure will follow.

00:39:32.038 --> 00:39:33.038
Hey!

00:39:33.894 --> 00:39:35.501
This is driving me crazy, seriously!

00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:46.041
Park Jungwon!

00:39:52.969 --> 00:39:54.669
Time, time, time, time!
Hold on, hold on!

00:40:10.085 --> 00:40:11.246
Yun Bia is here too!

00:40:11.247 --> 00:40:12.247
Director Yun!

00:40:18.985 --> 00:40:19.771
Director Yun, just a moment!

00:40:19.772 --> 00:40:20.846
Mr. Park Jungwon, hold on!

00:40:24.199 --> 00:40:25.336
Mr. Park Jungwon, just a moment!

00:40:25.337 --> 00:40:26.359
Mom will be back soon.

00:40:26.769 --> 00:40:28.259
Then we'll go see Dad.

00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:36.230
Isn't that the girl from earlier?

00:40:36.231 --> 00:40:37.511
She does look quite young.

00:40:39.888 --> 00:40:41.795
It's so sad for the kid.

00:40:41.796 --> 00:40:43.080
Mom, please open your eyes!

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.831
The kid is suffering for her mom's sins.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:56.351
I thought an hour would be enough.

00:40:59.234 --> 00:41:01.379
Wanting more would be greedy.

00:41:02.138 --> 00:41:04.209
So I thought I was okay with it.

00:41:05.459 --> 00:41:07.379
That's how I've lived my life.

00:41:08.937 --> 00:41:09.937
But at that moment,

00:41:11.227 --> 00:41:13.733
I started to wonder if I was wrong.

00:41:16.094 --> 00:41:19.877
What will happen to me now?

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:31.675
Once,

00:43:32.464 --> 00:43:34.594
that must have been a coincidence.

00:43:35.428 --> 00:43:36.428
Twice,

00:43:36.933 --> 00:43:40.511
this might not be just a coincidence.

00:43:42.157 --> 00:43:44.633
Mixed reality dating AI from 'It’s You'.

00:43:44.634 --> 00:43:45.196
HOMI

00:43:45.265 --> 00:43:45.961
Log in.

00:43:46.141 --> 00:43:48.700
You created a program
where people date an AI.

00:43:48.963 --> 00:43:51.706
CEO Yun, what do you think
love really is?

00:43:51.775 --> 00:43:54.189
Something that can change
whenever it wants

00:43:54.494 --> 00:43:56.816
and fragile, and imperfect.

00:44:01.141 --> 00:44:01.731
Hey, hey.

00:44:01.732 --> 00:44:03.556
Oysters are in season now.

00:44:03.654 --> 00:44:05.258
Your “face-ters”?

00:44:05.997 --> 00:44:07.619
I heard you don’t use rinse anymore?

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.952
Because Han Sunho is already a “Prince”!

00:44:10.828 --> 00:44:12.823
Making money off your looks,
how are you a writer?

00:44:12.824 --> 00:44:15.230
Living off your looks
isn’t something just anyone can do!

00:44:15.396 --> 00:44:17.617
Since I couldn’t make a
sentence for over 3 years.

00:44:17.672 --> 00:44:20.099
There was no way but
to make him a celebrity.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.290
Being acknowledged for
writing is what makes a writer.

00:44:25.531 --> 00:44:27.960
Even if the world is full of fakes,

00:44:27.961 --> 00:44:30.504
this is the cheapest knockoff of them all.

00:44:30.615 --> 00:44:31.584
A knockoff?

00:44:31.584 --> 00:44:32.584
Isn’t it?

00:44:32.776 --> 00:44:35.270
Hey, hey, it's the signal
of beast mode Yun Bia.

00:44:35.271 --> 00:44:37.637
Han Sunho, he’s got quite the impact.

00:44:41.328 --> 00:44:43.058
'It’s You' CEO Yun Bia.

00:44:43.169 --> 00:44:44.800
Dating with Writer Han Sunho?!

00:44:44.995 --> 00:44:46.300
This woman, seriously...

00:44:46.755 --> 00:44:47.904
Hey, Han Sunho!

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.109
She is thinking to play with you alive.

00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:53.988
It means we plan to take over
Writer Han Sun-ho’s agency,

00:44:53.989 --> 00:44:56.054
which has been held as collateral.

00:44:57.196 --> 00:44:58.626
- Wait a second!
- Let go, damn it!

00:45:02.285 --> 00:45:03.106
Got a plan?

00:45:03.106 --> 00:45:03.965
One way.

00:45:03.965 --> 00:45:04.520
What is it?

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.520
Dating.

00:45:06.474 --> 00:45:07.928
What can’t the two of us do?

00:45:08.025 --> 00:45:10.804
Let’s find out what
these people are plotting.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.024
Our goal is not to get caught,

00:45:13.025 --> 00:45:15.505
while gathering information
of Writer Han.

00:45:15.506 --> 00:45:17.717
Is this the project you
were talking about?

00:45:17.923 --> 00:45:20.026
Cancel the contract
or do whatever you want.

00:45:20.083 --> 00:45:21.352
Get ready to pay a penalty.

00:45:21.353 --> 00:45:22.754
Die, 'It’s You', die!

00:45:27.185 --> 00:45:29.345
You’re scared of forming relationships,
aren’t you?

00:45:29.715 --> 00:45:31.457
An hour, excuses, all that...

00:45:31.558 --> 00:45:33.001
What do you even know about me?

00:45:33.125 --> 00:45:35.354
The truth is you’re
afraid I might get hurt.

00:45:35.496 --> 00:45:38.189
CEO Yun, you never let people close,

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:39.530
except for CEO Seol.

00:45:40.168 --> 00:45:43.691
I thought an hour would be enough.

00:45:44.609 --> 00:45:46.488
I'm just worried about being caught.

00:45:46.502 --> 00:45:50.662
Breaking News. 'It’s You' CEO Yun Bia
collapses after an hour with people.

00:45:50.663 --> 00:45:51.984
Why are you getting in someone else’s car?

00:45:51.985 --> 00:45:54.168
Getting caught? Me?

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.193
Excuse me!

00:45:55.304 --> 00:45:56.304
Now...

00:45:57.769 --> 00:45:59.261
What’s going to happen to me?

00:46:00.312 --> 00:46:02.908
Does nobody know there’s a problem?

00:46:03.171 --> 00:46:05.336
This is the first time
I didn’t collapse after an hour.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.981
What if that person is the one
who can cure your symptoms?

00:46:08.022 --> 00:46:09.400
Your destined partner!

00:46:09.401 --> 00:46:11.764
Do you have a moment
you wish you could go back to?

00:46:12.042 --> 00:46:15.546
I don’t. Everything changes anyway.

00:46:15.877 --> 00:46:17.064
So that’s why you made it?

00:46:17.831 --> 00:46:19.031
Something that doesn’t change?

00:46:19.256 --> 00:46:22.309
Were you always this interested in me?

00:46:22.503 --> 00:46:24.143
I’m planning to be interested from now on.

00:46:27.676 --> 00:46:29.229
It’s best to call it off here.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.774
Until launch, we need Han Sunho.

00:46:31.775 --> 00:46:33.560
Not personally needing Han Sunho?

00:46:34.101 --> 00:46:36.190
Why don’t you take care of yourself?

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:38.609
I said I’m fine.

00:46:39.373 --> 00:46:40.634
Want me to hold your hand?

00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:42.272
You’re addicted, huh?

00:46:42.273 --> 00:46:43.313
Guardian angel!

00:46:43.354 --> 00:46:44.353
Not a stalker?

00:46:44.354 --> 00:46:45.393
You can’t live without me.

00:46:45.406 --> 00:46:48.993
When did I... You think I’m easy
just because you found my weakness?

00:46:49.104 --> 00:46:52.191
You’re the hardest thing for me,
Yun Bia.

00:46:52.979 --> 00:46:57.421
Could it be okay to bet
my fate on this man?
